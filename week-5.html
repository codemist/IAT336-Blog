					<h2>3D Printed Parts</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/3d-printing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						One of our main materials was plastic, and we as a team planned to use 3D printing
						as one of our fabrication methods with the CAD file that we made the previous week.
					</p>


					<h2>Trimming/Cutting</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/cutting-drawing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>We first started by measuring out the gaps in our 3D printed model, drawing out a quadrilateral shape
						on our other main material, cotton fabric, and then cutting out 4 pieces to fill out the form.
					</p>

					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/cutting-fabric.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<h2>Assembly</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/assembly-resolene.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>As we began placing the fabric within each half of the 3D printed form, we noticed that the cotton was too thin and delicate.
						Thus, we decided to apply resolene (an acrylic finisher) to our cutout fabrics to harden it in order to retain its folded form.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/assembly-tape.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>After the resolene had dried and hardened the cotton fabric, we placed it within the 3D printed model and used tape to 
						secure its placement, as well as making sure the fabric was pulled from edge to edge, leaving no gaps.
					</p>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/assembly 2 halves-1.jpg" alt="" /></span>


					<br><br>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/assembly-glue.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>We then used Methylene chloride, a solvent, to put the two halves together as well as to secure a fixed mount.	
						<br><br>
						Note: Ideally, this would have been a snap-fit closure (we built this into our CAD file) but unfortunately the snap-fit was too small and loose to keep it together.
						We decided to just glue the two halves instead, but in future iterations this would not be a necessity.		
					</p>

					<h2>Finishing</h2>

					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/finishing sand.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>We sanded the excess glue with an electronic file, in order to retain a clean, smooth finish as much as possible.</p>

					<br><br>

					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/finishing paint.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>We also painted over the magnetic tape strips with an ivory acrylic finish to make it blend better with the rest of the primarily ivory/white form.</p>


					<h2>Finished Outcome</h2>

					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/motus-final.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				
					<h2>Interaction</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/interaction-facingstraight.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The Motus Webcam can be used like a regular webcam via a mount. The webcam would be magnetically attached to 
						the mount.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/interaction-facingup.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>A significant feature of the Motus Webcam is being able to detach it from its mount altogether, in order to enable
						user mobility. Here, it sits on one of its faces, having the camera face upward from the user's desk.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 5/interaction-resourceful.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Another feature is resourcefulness - the user can move the Motus Webcam freely in their environment, 
						plopping it on any surface of their choice and on any of the faces that they'd choose to have different options of
						angles/heights/etc.
