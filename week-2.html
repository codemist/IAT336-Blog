					<p>This week, we were tasked as a team to create 3 different low fidelity models for our video
						camera.
						We were also tasked to identify which material/s you would use for the final product.
					</p>

					<h2>Concept 1</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 2/anna_webcam_model.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 2/anna_webcam_sketch.jpeg"

					<p>

						<div class="materials">
							<div class="material-item">
								<img src="images/Week 2/materials/feltfabric.jpg" class="material-img">
								<p class="material-name">Felt fabric</p>
							</div>
							<div class="material-item">
								<img src="images/Week 2/materials/3dprintingplastic.jpg" class="material-img">
								<p class="material-name">3D Printing plastic material</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						Material used are felt fabric and plastic filaments for 3D printing. The plastic will be the
						primary material used, while material will be used as a supporting material, as padding for the
						mount, and also used to extend the webcam.
						<br>
						<br>
						The webcam can be mounted on a computer screen, and the hinge allows the user to turn the back
						mount at any degree to accommodate for the size of the computer screen. As our persona requires
						a movable webcam that needs different heights and angle perspectives to showcase work in
						different locations, I added the functionality of extending the webcam so it can capture things
						higher up or further away.


					<h2>Concept 2</h2>


					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 2/sahil1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 2/sahil2.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<div class="materials">
						<div class="material-item">
							<img src="images/Week 2/materials/cottonplastic.jpeg" class="material-img">
							<p class="material-name">Felt fabric</p>
						</div>
						<div class="material-item">
							<img src="images/Week 2/materials/polyprophene.jpeg" class="material-img">
							<p class="material-name">Polystyrene sheet</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						Materials used for this build are 0.04 inch thick polystyrene, accompanied with a 100% cotton
						canvas. The stiff fabric is chosen to help retain the shape of the creases in the camera’s
						canvas extension.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Vanitian Lantern is designed to take up real-estate alongside other desktop objects such as
						PC speakers. When carried, an illuminated fabric shaft opens up to provide a keylight for
						objects in the camera’s vicinity. The camera can also be used horizontally with the user’s other
						hand holding the bottom of the light shaft. When placed back on a flat surface, the fabric folds
						neatly and obscures the light.

					</p>


					<h2>Concept 3</h2>

					<div class="materials">
						<div class="material-item">
							<img src="images/Week 2/materials/cottonplastic.jpeg" class="material-img">
							<p class="material-name">Canvas</p>
						</div>
						<div class="material-item">
							<img src="images/Week 2/materials/3dprintingplastic.jpg" class="material-img">
							<p class="material-name">3D Printing plastic material</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						Materials used for the model are 0.04 inch thick polystyrene, double sided tape and glue to
						connect the parts. For the final model, I would use a cotton blended canvas (a polyester/cotton mix), 
						which is a fabric with all the advantages of polyester and cotton. It has a superior tenacity and a natural feel. 
						It is primarily used as art canvas for painting and for inkjet printing of photos/artworks, but I aim to use it as the exterior
						case of the video camera's form.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						This concept features a honeycomb-like shape that serves as the form of the entire video camera. Unlike conventional video camera 
						that needs to be propped on a laptop or a monitor, this camera is meant to be an independent gadget that connects to the computer via bluetooth.
						It is purposely detached from the body of the computer, so as to give the user extra mobility when using the camera to point at objects around their
						space. The multiple faces helps helps to give the user different angle options for how to face the camera lens, and it is also easily placed on various objects
						(such as a pile of books) so as to be resourceful of the user's objects in customizing their desired height/angle for the camera.
