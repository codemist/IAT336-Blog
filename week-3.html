					<p> Our team decided to chose the honeycomb iteration of our video cam concept because it was the
						most viable
						design option for our persona.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						This concept features a honeycomb-like shape that serves as the form of the entire video camera.
						Unlike conventional video camera
						that needs to be propped on a laptop or a monitor, this camera is meant to be an independent
						gadget that connects to the computer via bluetooth.
						It is purposely detached from the body of the computer, so as to give the user extra mobility
						when using the camera to point at objects around their
						space. The multiple faces helps helps to give the user different angle options for how to face
						the camera lens, and it is also easily placed on various objects
						(such as a pile of books) so as to be resourceful of the user's objects in customizing their
						desired height/angle for the camera.
					</p>

						Each team member for this phase of the project chose to work on each particular phase of the
						project, as per outlined
						above.

					<h2>Testing with a Paper Model</h2>

					<br>
					<p>
						We first tested out our concept with a low fidelity paper prototype to have a feel for the
						dimensions,
						size and form of the model which we were eventually going to do a high fidelity prototype of.
					</p>

					<br>

					<h2>Trimming/Cutting (Kaitlyn)</h2>
					<p>
						I used a penknife to cut through the Polystyrene sheets (0.04 inch thick), making 2 thick strips
						of
						the polystyrene material that would make out the rigid form of the honeycomb exterior. I
						then cut out 4 pieces of fabric in an oval-like shape from a cotton canvas sheet with a pair of
						scissors.
					</p>

					<h2>Assembly (Anna)</h2>
					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 3/bending.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>
						I made equal 7 folds per each polystyrene sheet to make 8 1" by 1" squares that could be
						bent into a honey-comb shape. Using a hairdryer, I positioned the heat onto the creases to
						create
						deeper folds. I used methyl adhesive to connect each strip end to end, and then placed the two
						pieces
						interwining together to create a 3D form with double sided tape. I then used glue to fill in the
						gaps in the
						honeycomb shape with the oval cutouts of the cotton canvas.
					</p>

					<h2>Finishing (Sahil)</h2>

					<span class="image"><img class="in-blog" src="images/Week 3/Webcam2.jpg" alt="" /></span>


					<p>
						For finishing, I used a 180-grit sandpaper to sand down the excess glue to smooth out the form
						of the prototype.
